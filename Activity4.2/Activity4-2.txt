1.1 DoubleComparison:

4. The value of the result variable is 0.09999999999999998, and the value of the expected variable is 0.10000000000000000.
They are not the same value because the result variable needed to be rounded in order to be stored as a double, resulting in the exact value of the expected variable.

5. The code will intially go into the else-statement because the necessary conditiions for the if-statement to run have not been met.

8. With my alterations, the code now goes into the if-statement, as the necessary conditions have now been met.

1.2 StringComparison:

2. The value of CODE_WORD is "peanut," and its id is 19. The value of myWord is also "peanut," and its id is also 19.

3. After using "Step over" the code goes into the if-statement, because the conditions that CODE_WORD == myWord have been met.

6. The value of CODE_WORD is "peanut," and its id is 21. However, while the input also equals "peanut," its id is 23.

7. The code goes into the else-statement, because the strings are not being compared properly, causing the code to see the correct satement as false.

1.3 CharacterComparison:

2. The value of first letter is p, and the value of asciiValue is 112.
